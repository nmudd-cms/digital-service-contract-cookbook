# Digital Service Contract Cookbook
The goal of the Contract Cookbook is to provide an easy mechanism for digital service teams within the United States Federal government to create contracting language for procuring digial services.

Additionally, the tasks defined in this project will evolve and mature using the same methods the open source development community use to build software.
