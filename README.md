# Digital Service Contract Cookbook
The goal of the "Digital Services Contract Cookbook" is to provide an easy mechanism for digital service teams within the United States Federal government to create contracting language for procuring digital services.

Additionally, the tasks defined in this project will evolve and mature using the same methods the open source development community use to build software.

All tasks are defined in the _tasks folder. See our [contributing guide] (/CONTRIBUTING.md) if your interested in helping out.
