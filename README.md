# Digital Service Contract Cookbook
The goal of the [Digital Services Contract Cookbook](http://nmudd-cms.github.io/digital-service-contracting-cookbook/) is to provide an easy mechanism for digital service teams within the U.S. Federal Government to create contracting language for procuring digital services that embrace the [USDS Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/).

All contract tasks are defined in the `_tasks` folder. See our [contributing guide] (/CONTRIBUTING.md) if your interested in helping out.

To read more about the motivation behind this project. Take a look at the [product charter](#).
